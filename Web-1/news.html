            <h2>Take part in this week's PvP Brawl: Temple of the Swiftmogu</h2>
            <p>The Magnificent Six Brawl pits two teams of six players against three iconic battlegrounds: Warsong Gulch, Glitter Mines, and Temple of Kotmogu. The format of battles on each battlefield differs from the standard one. For example, the flags on the Warsong Gulch battlefield are located closer together, there are fewer minecarts to escort in the Glitter Mines, and only two orbs spawn in the Temple of Kotmogu.</p>

            <h2>Weekly Event: Time Travel in Mists of Pandaria</h2>
            <p>During the special event, players will have the opportunity to earn new rewards throughout the week in six iconic Mists of Pandaria dungeons. Simply open the party finder (default key: I), select “Dungeon Finder,” and select “Time Travel” from the drop-down menu. Once you click "Find Group", the system will select a group of players for you and take you to one of the heroic dungeons. Your character and equipment will level down according to the difficulty of the challenge, but the loot from the bosses will correspond to the real level. While traveling through time through dungeons, there is a chance to obtain items usually available in Heroic mode, as well as gain reputation with the corresponding faction.</p>

            <h2>Darkmoon Faire returns</h2>
            <p>The Darkmoon Wooden Coaster is the largest, tallest, and fastest in Azeroth! Hold on tight and ride with the breeze as you enjoy the twists and turns and dizzying climbs and descents of the unstable and winding wooden trolley track. There are no height restrictions, so dwarves, gnomes and goblins can ride to their heart's content.

                All riders are given the positive effect “UUUUUH!”, increasing the amount of experience and reputation gained by one hour. The increase in experience will be very useful when collecting sets of traditional armor and discovering allied races, the number of which has been supplemented by vulperas and mechagnomes.</p>

            <h2>The Torghast: Choir of the Dead event has begun!</h2>
            <p>In the Shadowlands expansion, players will find three new events in Torghast, Tower of the Damned, where participants will gain special anima abilities. This way, players will have a lot of incredible abilities at their disposal that will come in handy while exploring the halls of Torghast. If you select an anima themed ability at the start of a dungeon visit, the options offered later will also change to include new themed abilities.

                For example, if during the Beasts of Prodigum event you choose an ability related to the Maw Beast, then after that you will receive anima abilities in Torghast that further enhance your creature. If you refuse the new anima ability and prefer the regular one, then until the end of your visit to Torghast you will not receive thematic abilities.</p>

            <h2>Remember our departed heroes on Day of the Dead!</h2>
            <p>Do you feel a chill?
                It was on the Day of the Dead that the door to the world of spirits opened.
                That's why we decorate the graves of friends and relatives who have left us with flowers and candles, and place gifts on the gravestones: we want to welcome them into our world, even if they will only stay with us for a short time.
                Come! Dance with me!
                Let's pay our respects to the ghosts of those we have lost. Let them smile again and share in the feast, knowing that they are still loved. Katrina</p>
